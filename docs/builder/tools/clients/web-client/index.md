# Web SDK (@miden-sdk/miden-sdk)

The Web SDK is the browser-focused toolkit for the Miden network. It wraps the Rust client, compiles to WebAssembly, and exposes a typed JavaScript API through the `MidenClient` class. Use it from web apps, wallets, dApps, service workers, Node servers — any JavaScript runtime that supports Web Workers and WebAssembly.

## Capabilities

- Read and write onchain state: accounts, notes, transactions, tags.
- Build and execute Miden transactions, including custom MASM scripts.
- Compile Miden Assembly into account components, transaction scripts, and note scripts directly in the browser.
- Generate zero-knowledge proofs locally via the in-browser prover, or offload proving to a remote or delegated prover.
- Manage keys through built-in Falcon/ECDSA keystores or external signer integrations.
- Exchange private notes through the Miden note transport network.
- Import / export account files, note files, and full store snapshots for backup and migration.

```

The SDK is built from the `web-client` Rust crate in [0xMiden/miden-client](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client), compiled with `wasm-bindgen`, and bundled with the WASM module, JavaScript bindings, and a dedicated Web Worker script.

## Resource management

Each `MidenClient` instance holds a dedicated Web Worker thread. When you no longer need a client — for example in a multi-wallet app that creates one client per active network — call `client.terminate()` to release the worker.

```typescript
import { MidenClient } from "@miden-sdk/miden-sdk";

const client = await MidenClient.createTestnet();

// ... use the client ...

// Free the Web Worker when you are done
client.terminate();
```

In environments that support the TC39 [explicit resource management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) proposal, you can use `using` to let the runtime handle cleanup automatically:

```typescript
{
  using client = await MidenClient.createTestnet();
  // ... client.terminate() is called automatically when the block exits
}
```

After `terminate()`, every subsequent method call throws `Error("Client terminated")`.

## Where to go next

- [Setup](./setup.md) — install the SDK and create your first client.
- [Accounts](./accounts.md) — create wallets, faucets, and contract accounts; look up existing ones.
- [Transactions](./transactions.md) — mint, send, consume, swap, and run custom scripts.
- [Notes](./notes.md) — list, import, export, and transport private notes.
- [Compile](./compile.md) — turn Miden Assembly into account components and scripts.
- [Sync and store](./sync.md) — pull network state and manage the local database.
- [Testing](./testing.md) — drive a fully in-memory mock chain for fast, deterministic tests.

## Migrating from `WebClient`

The v0.13 flat `WebClient` class is deprecated. v0.14 introduces `MidenClient` with resource-based namespaces (`client.accounts`, `client.transactions`, …). See the [v0.13 → v0.14 Web SDK migration guide](../../../migration/07-client-changes.md) for the full delta.
