# Note Transport

The Miden note transport service is an offchain relay for private note delivery. It gives senders a place to publish serialized private notes and gives recipients a way to fetch notes that match the tags they monitor.

Private note contents are not published onchain. The chain stores note commitments, while the full note data must reach the recipient through another channel. Note transport is the standard network service for that offchain delivery path.

## API surface

| RPC | Use it for | Current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SendNote` | Publish one transported note. | The `header` must decode as a Miden `NoteHeader`; `details` are stored as opaque bytes. |
| `FetchNotes` | Durable catch-up by tag. | Returns notes for one or more tags using a server-assigned `seq` cursor. |
| `StreamNotes` | Live updates for one tag. | Use it after a fetch cycle; current subscriptions do not initialize from the request cursor. |
| `Stats` | Basic operational counts. | Returns aggregate note and tag counts. Per-tag statistics are defined in protobuf but not populated yet. |

## Transport model

- **Private payload delivery.** The Miden chain stores note commitments. Note transport carries the full private note data that recipients need to import locally.
- **Tag-based routing.** Notes are indexed by the 32-bit `NoteTag` embedded in note metadata. The node has no account registry or recipient identity model.
- **Client-owned privacy policy.** The node parses note headers only. Clients decide which tags to monitor and whether note details should be encrypted before sending.
- **Temporary mailbox.** Notes are retained for the configured retention window. Delivery is best-effort and clients must persist fetch cursors.

## Current boundaries

- **No chain-state validation.** The node does not connect to a Miden node and does not prove that a stored note was committed onchain.
- **No block context yet.** The current API does not attach commitment block numbers, note metadata, or inclusion proofs to fetched notes. This is tracked in [0xMiden/note-transport-service#68](https://github.com/0xMiden/note-transport-service/issues/68).
- **Duplicate notes are rejected.** SQLite stores note IDs with a uniqueness constraint. Sending the same note twice fails instead of creating duplicate rows.
- **Cursor values are server-owned.** Fetch pagination uses the monotonic SQLite `seq` value returned by the server. Clients should persist returned cursors, not fabricate them.

## Current implementation

The current node implementation is a Rust gRPC service backed by SQLite. It stores each note with a monotonic `seq` value assigned at insert time, uses that value for `FetchNotes` pagination, and can export traces and metrics through OpenTelemetry.
