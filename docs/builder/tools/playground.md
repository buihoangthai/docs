# Miden Playground

An interactive browser environment for writing, compiling, and executing Miden Assembly (MASM) programs. No installation required — prototype account code, test note scripts, and experiment with VM instructions straight from a URL.

<CardGrid cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open the Playground ↗" href="https://playground.miden.xyz/" eyebrow="External · playground.miden.xyz">
    Launch the browser IDE and start writing MASM immediately.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Miden VM reference" href="/reference" eyebrow="Reference · MASM">
    Instruction set, stack semantics, chiplets, and assembler behaviour.

## What you can do

<CardGrid cols={3}>
  <Card title="Write MASM" eyebrow="Editor">
    Syntax-highlighted editor with inline error reporting for the Miden assembler.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execute programs" eyebrow="VM">
    Run programs against the Miden VM in-browser and inspect the resulting stack and memory.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Share snippets" eyebrow="Workflow">
    Shareable URLs with embedded code for reproducing bugs or teaching examples.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Callout variant="tip" title="When to graduate from the Playground">
The Playground shines for learning MASM and for quick prototyping. For anything bigger than a snippet — components, storage, note dispatch, transaction flows — move to a `miden new` Rust project locally. See [your first smart contract](../get-started/your-first-smart-contract) for the handoff.
