# Rust Smart Contracts

The Rust SDK is the long-term direction for Miden smart-contract development: define account components, note scripts, and transaction scripts in idiomatic `#![no_std]` Rust with typed storage, attribute macros, and client-side proving. The SDK compiles to Miden Assembly (MASM) under the hood, so the same execution model and standards library apply.

:::caution Currently in active development
The Rust SDK is being actively developed and is **not yet production-ready for mainnet**. For production deployments today, write contracts in [Miden Assembly (MASM)](../masm/) — the supported path Miden mainnet verifies. Use the Rust SDK for prototyping, experimentation, and exploration of the long-term direction.

The pages below describe the Rust SDK's current shape: how accounts and components compose, how notes are scripted, how transactions execute, and the patterns you can already build with.

## When to choose Rust vs MASM today

| Concern | Rust SDK | MASM |
|---|---|---|
| **Mainnet production** | In active development | [Supported today](../masm/) |
| **Ergonomics** | Familiar Rust idioms, type-checked storage, attribute macros | Stack-based assembly, explicit control |
| **Compilation target** | Compiles via Wasm → MASM | Directly authored |
| **Use case** | Long-term default once mature; prototyping and exploration today | Production contracts for mainnet |

Both authoring paths share the same [Miden Standards](../standards/) library — standard components, notes, and faucet policies are callable from either.
