# Miden Smart Contracts

This section covers the developer-facing paths for building smart contracts on Miden: an authoring guide for **Miden Assembly (MASM)** (the supported path for mainnet production today) and **Rust** (in active development as the long-term direction), plus the [Miden Standards](./standards/) library of reusable components callable from either.

:::tip Building for mainnet?
Miden mainnet supports smart contracts authored in **Miden Assembly (MASM)** today. The Rust SDK is in active development and will become the default authoring path once it ships v1. For production deployments now, see [MASM Smart Contracts](./masm/).
:::

If you're new to Miden, the hands-on [Miden Bank Tutorial](../tutorials/miden-bank/) walks through the full lifecycle using the Rust SDK; the concepts (accounts, notes, transactions, components) translate directly to MASM.
