# Common Pitfalls

This reference documents known issues and limitations when developing with the Miden Rust compiler, along with recommended workarounds.

## Felt Comparison Operators

### Problem

Direct comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) on `Felt` values produce incorrect results.

```rust
// WRONG: This does NOT work correctly
let a = Felt::new(100);
let b = Felt::new(200);
if a < b {  // May produce unexpected results!
    // ...
}
```

### Solution

Always convert Felt values to `u64` before comparing:

```rust
// CORRECT: Convert to u64 first
let a = Felt::new(100);
let b = Felt::new(200);
if a.as_u64() < b.as_u64() {
    // Works correctly
}
```

### Example from Bank Contract

```rust title="contracts/bank-account/src/lib.rs"
// Validating deposit amount
let amount = asset.unwrap_fungible().amount().as_u64();

// Use u64 comparison
assert!(
    amount <= MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT,  // MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT is u64
    "Deposit exceeds maximum"
);
```

:::warning Always Use .as_u64()
Any time you compare Felt values, convert them first. This applies to:
- Amount comparisons
- Balance checks
- Index comparisons
- Any numeric ordering
:::

## Stack Limit (16 Elements)

### Problem

The Miden VM stack only allows direct access to the first 16 elements. Complex functions with many local variables trigger this error:

```
invalid stack index: only the first 16 elements on the stack are directly accessible
```

This may also appear as:
```
values not found in advice provider
```

### Solution

**1. Reduce local variables:**

```rust
// WRONG: Too many local variables
fn complex_operation(&mut self) {
    let a = self.get_a();
    let b = self.get_b();
    let c = self.get_c();
    let d = self.get_d();
    let e = self.get_e();
    let f = self.get_f();
    // ... more variables cause stack overflow
}

// CORRECT: Use values directly or minimize locals
fn complex_operation(&mut self) {
    // Process in smaller batches
    let result_ab = self.process(self.get_a(), self.get_b());
    let result_cd = self.process(self.get_c(), self.get_d());
    self.finalize(result_ab, result_cd);
}
```

**2. Break into smaller functions:**

```rust
// WRONG: One large function
fn do_everything(&mut self, a: Word, b: Word, c: Word) {
    // Many operations touching all parameters...
}

// CORRECT: Split into stages
fn stage_one(&mut self, a: Word) -> Felt {
    // Process a
}

fn stage_two(&mut self, b: Word, result: Felt) -> Felt {
    // Process b with result from stage one
}

fn stage_three(&mut self, c: Word, result: Felt) {
    // Final processing
}
```

**3. Process iteratively:**

```rust
// CORRECT: Process one at a time
for asset in assets {
    self.process_single_asset(asset);
}
```

---

## Function Argument Limit (4 Words)

### Problem

Miden functions can receive at most 4 Words (16 Felts) as arguments:

```
error: expected at most 4 words of arguments
```

```rust
// WRONG: Too many arguments
fn process(
    &mut self,
    depositor: AccountId,    // ~1 Word
    asset: Asset,            // 1 Word
    serial_num: Word,        // 1 Word
    tag: Felt,               // 1 Felt
    note_type: Felt,         // 1 Felt
    extra_data: Word,        // 1 Word - EXCEEDS LIMIT!
) {
    // ...
}
```

### Solution

**1. Make sure to only pass 4 Words to functions:**

```rust
// CORRECT: Only pass 4 Words
fn process(
    &mut self,
    depositor: AccountId,    // ~1 Word
    asset: Asset,            // 1 Word
    serial_num: Word,        // 1 Word
    params: Word,            // [tag, note_type, 0, 0] - 1 Word
) {
    let tag = params[0];
    let note_type = params[1];
    // ...
}
```

**2. Use note storage for passing data:**

For note scripts, pass complex data via `active_note::get_storage()`:

```rust
#[note]
struct MyNote;

#[note]
impl MyNote {
    #[note_script]
    fn run(self, _arg: Word) {
        let storage = active_note::get_storage();
        // Storage can hold many Felts without function argument limits
        let param1 = storage[0];
        let param2 = storage[1];
        // ... access up to the full storage capacity
    }
}
```

**3. Store data first, reference by key:**

```rust
// Store complex data in storage
fn store_config(&mut self, key: Word, config_data: Word) {
    self.configs.set(key, config_data);
}

// Reference by key in other operations
fn process_with_config(&mut self, key: Word) {
    let config = self.configs.get(&key);
    // Use config...
}
```

---

## Array Ordering (Rust/MASM Reversal)

### Problem

Arrays passed from Rust to the Miden VM are received in **reversed order**.

```rust
// In Rust, you define:
let word = Word::from([a, b, c, d]);

// In MASM, this becomes: [d, c, b, a]
```

### Solution

Be aware of this when:
- Constructing storage keys
- Parsing note inputs
- Working with asset data

**Example: Storage Key Construction**

```rust
// Balance key format in Rust
let key = Word::from([
    depositor.prefix().as_felt(),  // Position 0 in Rust
    depositor.suffix(),             // Position 1
    faucet.prefix().as_felt(),      // Position 2
    faucet.suffix(),                // Position 3
]);

// When the VM processes this, it sees:
// [faucet.suffix, faucet.prefix, depositor.suffix, depositor.prefix]
```

**Example: Asset Structure**

```rust
// Asset Word layout (Rust perspective)
// [amount, 0, faucet_suffix, faucet_prefix]

let asset_word = Word::from([
    Felt::new(amount),           // [0] amount
    Felt::new(0),                // [1] padding
    faucet.id().suffix(),        // [2] faucet suffix
    faucet.id().prefix().as_felt(), // [3] faucet prefix
]);
```

:::tip Consistency is Key
The reversal doesn't matter as long as you're **consistent**. Always construct and parse arrays the same way throughout your codebase.

## Felt Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow

### Problem

Miden uses field element (Felt) arithmetic, which operates in a prime field with modulus `p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1`. This means arithmetic is **modular** and will silently wrap around instead of causing an error.

```rust
// DANGEROUS: This does NOT error on underflow!
let balance = Felt::new(100);
let withdrawal = Felt::new(500);
let new_balance = balance - withdrawal;  // Silently wraps to a huge positive number!
```

When you subtract a larger value from a smaller one, the result wraps around to a large positive number (approximately `2^64`). This is NOT an error in the Miden VM - the transaction will succeed with an incorrect balance.

### Why This Happens

The Miden VM performs all Felt arithmetic as modular operations within the prime field. There is no automatic overflow or underflow detection at the VM level. The Rust compiler's default overflow mode is `Unchecked`, meaning it compiles directly to raw VM arithmetic operations.

### Solution

**Always validate before subtraction:**

```rust
// CORRECT: Check balance before subtracting
let current_balance: Felt = self.balances.get(&key);
let withdraw_amount = withdraw_asset.inner[0];

// Validate that balance is sufficient
assert!(
    current_balance.as_u64() >= withdraw_amount.as_u64(),
    "Withdrawal amount exceeds available balance"
);

// Only subtract after validation
let new_balance = current_balance - withdraw_amount;
```

### Example from Bank Contract

```rust title="contracts/bank-account/src/lib.rs"
pub fn withdraw(&mut self, depositor: AccountId, withdraw_asset: Asset, /* ... */) {
    let withdraw_amount = withdraw_asset.inner[0];

    // Get current balance and validate sufficient funds exist.
    // This check is critical: Felt arithmetic is modular, so subtracting
    // more than the balance would silently wrap to a large positive number.
    let current_balance: Felt = self.balances.get(&key);
    assert!(
        current_balance.as_u64() >= withdraw_amount.as_u64(),
        "Withdrawal amount exceeds available balance"
    );

    let new_balance = current_balance - withdraw_amount;
    self.balances.set(key, new_balance);
}
```

:::danger Critical Security Issue
Failure to validate before subtraction can lead to:
- Users withdrawing more than their balance
- Balance values becoming astronomically large
- Complete loss of funds in the contract

**Always check bounds before Felt subtraction operations.**
:::

## Wallet Component Requirement

### Problem

The `active_note::add_assets_to_account()` function fails if the consuming account doesn't have the basic wallet component.

```
Error: Account does not support asset operations
```

### Solution

Ensure accounts that receive assets via this function have wallet capability:

```rust
use miden_client::account::component::BasicWallet;

// When creating an account that needs to receive assets
let account = AccountBuilder::new(seed)
    .with_component(BasicWallet)  // Add wallet capability
    .with_component(YourCustomComponent)
    .build()?;
```

**Alternative: Use `native_account::add_asset()`**

For account components, use the native account API instead:

```rust
#[component]
impl Bank {
    pub fn deposit(&mut self, depositor: AccountId, asset: Asset) {
        // This works for any account - no wallet required
        native_account::add_asset(asset);

        // Track balance in storage
        self.update_balance(depositor, asset);
    }
}
```

---

## Storage Map Key Consistency

### Problem

Storage map lookups return unexpected results or zeros when keys are constructed inconsistently.

### Solution

Define a single key construction pattern and use it everywhere:

```rust title="contracts/bank-account/src/lib.rs"
#[component]
impl Bank {
    /// Construct a balance key for a depositor and asset.
    /// Key format: [depositor_prefix, depositor_suffix, faucet_prefix, faucet_suffix]
    fn balance_key(&self, depositor: AccountId, faucet_id: AccountId) -> Word {
        Word::from([
            depositor.prefix().as_felt(),
            depositor.suffix(),
            faucet_id.prefix().as_felt(),
            faucet_id.suffix(),
        ])
    }

    pub fn get_balance(&self, depositor: AccountId, faucet_id: AccountId) -> Felt {
        let key = self.balance_key(depositor, faucet_id);
        self.balances.get(&key)
    }

    fn update_balance(&mut self, depositor: AccountId, faucet_id: AccountId, amount: Felt) {
        let key = self.balance_key(depositor, faucet_id);
        self.balances.set(key, amount);
    }
}
```

## Note Type Values

### Problem

When creating output notes, the `note_type` parameter uses specific integer values that aren't obvious.

### Solution

Use the correct values for note types:

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Public | Note data is visible on-chain |
| 2 | Private | Note data is hidden (only hash on-chain) |

```rust
// In note inputs or when creating output notes
let note_type = Felt::new(1);  // Public note
// or
let note_type = Felt::new(2);  // Private note
```

---

## P2ID Script Root

### Problem

When creating P2ID (Pay-to-ID) output notes, you need the script's MAST root. The v0.13 pattern of hardcoding the digest is fragile — it hashes under RPO, which v0.14 replaced with Poseidon2, and any future change to the P2ID script invalidates the constant silently.

### Solution (v0.14)

Carry the P2ID script root on the initiating note's storage and read it at runtime instead of hardcoding a value. This is the pattern used in the v0.14 `miden-bank` example:

```rust title="contracts/bank-account/src/lib.rs"
// The withdraw-request note encodes the P2ID script root at storage slots
// 10..14 (4 felts = 1 Word). The Poseidon2-hashed digest of the P2ID note
// script is injected by the caller when the note is created.
let storage = active_note::get_storage();
let script_root = Word::from([
    storage[10], storage[11], storage[12], storage[13],
]);

// Pass the script root through to the P2ID-note constructor
self.create_p2id_note(serial_num, &asset, depositor, tag, note_type, script_root);
```

On the client side, compute the script root dynamically from the standard P2ID note script instead of hardcoding it:

```rust
use miden_client::note::P2idNote;

// v0.14: ask miden-standards for the current P2ID script, take its MAST root.
let p2id_script_root: Word = P2idNote::script().root();
```

:::info Why Not Hardcode
The native hash function changed from RPO to Poseidon2 in v0.14, so every MAST root — including the P2ID script's — is different from v0.13. Any hardcoded digest from v0.13 will fail a script-root check against v0.14. Reading the root from `P2idNote::script().root()` (or the active note's storage for on-chain code) keeps the contract resilient to future script changes.

## Empty Transaction (No State Change, No Notes)

### Problem

Every Miden transaction must either change tracked account state (storage, vault, or nonce) **or** consume at least one input note. A transaction that does neither is rejected.

The Rust client surfaces this as `TransactionRequestError::NoInputNotesNorAccountChange` before submission:

```
empty transaction: the request has no input notes and no account state changes
```

The VM kernel enforces the same invariant during execution, surfacing the message:

```
executed transaction neither changed the account state, nor consumed any notes
```

This commonly catches transaction scripts that take a no-op branch — the script ran fine, but nothing in its body mutated state:

```rust
#[tx_script]
fn run(arg: Word, account: &mut Account) {
    let should_settle = arg[0];
    if should_settle == felt!(1) {
        account.settle();  // mutates state
    }
    // WRONG: when should_settle != felt!(1), the script returns
    //        without mutating state and the transaction is rejected.
}
```

The script executed correctly — Miden just refuses to admit transactions with no observable effect.

### Solution

Give every branch something to mutate, or record the no-op explicitly so the transaction has a state delta:

```rust
#[tx_script]
fn run(arg: Word, account: &mut Account) {
    let should_settle = arg[0];
    if should_settle == felt!(1) {
        account.settle();
    } else {
        // Record the attempt so the transaction still has a state delta.
        account.record_attempt();
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if the flow naturally consumes a note (most do — note scripts mutate state when they run), make sure the transaction request includes at least one input note. Pass the `Note` (the client deduces authentication from the note record) along with optional `NoteArgs`:

```rust
let request = TransactionRequestBuilder::new()
    .input_notes(vec![(input_note, None)])
    .build()?;
```

:::tip Standard auth handles this for you
Most account templates run an authentication procedure that calls `incr_nonce()` on every transaction. If your account uses `BasicWallet`, `IncrNonceAuthComponent`, or any auth component that increments the nonce, you only hit this pitfall in transaction-script-only flows that skip the auth path. See [Authentication](../../smart-contracts/accounts/authentication) for details.
:::

### Why this exists

A Miden transaction commits to a state delta plus a set of consumed notes. A transaction with neither is indistinguishable from "no transaction at all" — admitting it would waste a block slot and a proof verification. The invariant lets the network reject empty proofs cheaply.

## Quick Reference Table

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Felt comparison | Wrong comparison results | Use `.as_u64()` |
| Stack overflow | "16 elements" error | Reduce locals, split functions |
| Too many args | "4 words" error | Group into Words, use inputs |
| Array reversal | Wrong data order | Be consistent with construction |
| Felt underflow | Balance wraps to huge number | Validate before subtraction |
| Missing wallet | Asset operation fails | Add `BasicWallet` component |
| Key mismatch | Zero balances | Use helper function for keys |
| Note type | Wrong note visibility | Use 1 (Public) or 2 (Private) |
| Empty transaction | "Neither changed account state nor consumed notes" | Mutate state in every path, or consume a note |
